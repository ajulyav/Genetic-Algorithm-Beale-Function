## Genetic Algorithm for Global Optimization of Multimodal Function (Beale Function)

Genetic algorithms (GAs) are stochastic-based heuristic search techniques that incorporate three primary operators: selection, crossover, and mutation. These operators are supportive in obtaining the optimal solution for constrained optimization problems:

(i)	  Generate initial population

(ii)	The process of parents’ selection for reproduction of offspring

(iii)	Crossover and mutation of individuals

(iv)	Predefine stopping criteria

The developed algorithm solves the Minimization of the Beale function problem (please find below more). 

The main window of the program is shown below. Various selection, crossover, and mutation options have been implemented. Also, the user can select other parameters of the algorithm, for example, the number of iterations, the size of the population, the percentage of mutation, etc.

In the image on the right, one can see the results of running the algorithm. In particular, the optimal found value is close to the global minimum (= 0). The graph displays the optimal minimum value of the function found at each iteration.

The Beale function is multimodal, with sharp peaks at the corners of the input domain.

Dimensions: 2

Input Domain: The function is usually evaluated on the square xi ∈ [-4.5, 4.5], for all i = 1, 2.
